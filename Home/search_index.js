In particular, the precession and nutation transformation accounts for the  changing orientation of the Earth's axis and defines the zero point for  right-ascensions. Indeed, the equatorial plane of the Earth and the ecliptic  plane undergo small changes in time, which have mathematically been divided into  precessional (long period) and nutational (short period) oscillations. These  effects are due to the gravitational forces of the planets, of the Sun and of the Moon.  Additionally, since Earth is not spherical, the latter also induce a torque on  the Earth and on its equatorial bulge.

With IAU 2000 Resolution B1.6, two new models to account for precession and nutation effects were recommended, depending on the requested accuracy level. In particular, for high-precision applications (e.g., with accuracies measured in microarcseconds), the recommended model is the IAU 2000A [3]. Since the large size of such model is often an unnecessary overhead and may exhaust the available resources, a shortened version called IAU 2000B [4] has been developed with accuracies at the 1 mas level throughout 1995-2050. However, since the precession part of the IAU 2000A model consisted only of corrections to the precession rates of the IAU 1976 precession, IAU 2006 Resolution B1 recommended that the precession component of the IAU 2000A precession-nutation model should be replaced by the P03 precession theory of Capitaine [5] in order to be consistent with the dynamical theory. In the following documentation, the IAU precession-nutation model resulting from IAU 2000 Resolution B1.6 and IAU 2006 Resolution B1 is denoted the IAU 2006/2000 precession nutation model.\nCIP: IAU 2000 Resolution B1.7 recommends that the Celestial Intermediate Pole (CIP) be implemented in place of the Celestial Ephemeris Pole (CEP) starting from January 2003.\nEarth Rotation Angle: IAU 2000 Resolution B1.7 recommends that the transformation between the ITRS and GCRS be specified by the position of the CIP in the GCRS/ITRS and by the Earth Rotation Angle (ERA), a linear function of UT1.
