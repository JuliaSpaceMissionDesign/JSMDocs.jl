# Mission

We are developing a comprehensive software package ecosystem for space mission design and simulation. 
Our ecosystem will enable users to design and simulate every aspect of a mission, from the initial 
conceptual design to operations, using modular, extensible, and easy-to-use packages. 

Our packages will be designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use. This means 
that users can choose the packages that suit their needs, combine them in different ways, 
and customize them as they wish. Our packages will also follow common standards and interfaces, 
so that they can be integrated with other tools and frameworks.

One of the frameworks that we will leverage is [SciML], a scientific machine learning ecosystem that 
provides high-performance, scalable, and differentiable solutions for scientific computing. 
SciML offers a variety of packages for solving various scientific problems, such as differential 
equations, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and more.

We will also introduce AI within our ecosystem to create efficient digital twins of satellites. A digital 
twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that can be used to monitor, analyze, and optimize its 
performance. By using AI, we will create digital twins that can learn from data, adapt to changes, 
and generate predictions and recommendations. This will enable us to improve the design, testing, and 
operation of satellites, as well as to detect and prevent failures, anomalies, and faults.

Our mission is to create a software package ecosystem that can help users to design and simulate space 
missions in a fast, accurate, and reliable way. We hope that our ecosystem will contribute to the 
advancement of space science and technology, and inspire innovations.
