# Gravitational Models

Gravitational models play a crucial role in engineering applications related to space 
missions, satellite operations, and celestial mechanics. These models provide a mathematical 
representation of the gravitational field of celestial bodies, enabling engineers to accurately 
predict orbits, plan trajectories, and design spacecraft missions with precision.

Various gravitational models are employed to meet specific requirements and account for 
different levels of complexity. One commonly used model is the **Two-Body Problem**, which assumes 
that the gravitational interaction between two celestial bodies, such as a satellite and 
a planet, is the dominant force affecting their motion. This simplified model is often 
leveraged for preliminary orbit design.

For more accurate calculations, more sophisticated models are required, such as the 
**n-Body Problem**: it considers the gravitational interactions among multiple celestial 
bodies, accounting for the gravitational influences of planets, moons, and other significant 
objects within a celestial system. These models are essential for precise orbit determination, 
long-term mission planning, and deep space missions where multiple gravitational forces come into play.
The aim of this part of the documentation is to provide a concise, clear and mathematically accurate 
representation of the most used gravitational models.
