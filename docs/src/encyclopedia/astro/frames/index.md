# Reference Frames & Transformations

Astronomical reference frames play a vital role in engineering applications related to space 
exploration, satellite navigation, and astrodynamics. These reference frames provide a 
standardized system for precisely defining the positions, motions, and orientations of 
celestial objects, enabling engineers to navigate through space, track satellites, and plan 
spacecraft missions with accuracy and precision.

In engineering, different reference frames are employed to meet specific requirements and 
facilitate various tasks. The aim of this part of the documentation is to provide a concise, 
clear and mathematically accurate representation of the most used reference frames.
